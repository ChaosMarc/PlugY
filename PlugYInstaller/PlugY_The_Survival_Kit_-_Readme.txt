******** INSTALLATION ********
Normal Installation :
- Follow directive installer.

note : You can choice "Diablo II" directory as install directory.

Installation in another mod:
- Copy PlugY.ini, PlugY.exe and PlugY folder (+its contents) in the targeted mod folder.
- Edit PlugY.ini to configure some features (see section below).
- Run PlugY.exe.


Example :
You have installed Lord of Destruction in :  C:\Games\Diablo II\
And the target mod is in : D:\D2Mod\MyMod\
And the second mod is in : D:\D2Mod\MyMod2\
So the new installation is :
   C:\Games\Diablo II\PlugY.dll
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\SharedGoldBtns.dc6
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\PlugYFixed.ini
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\PlugYDefault.ini
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\EmptyPage.dc6

Uninstallation : Use the uninstaller or simply remove all PlugY files.
Note : You can also move PlugY.dll in the mod folder but you must remove any on in D2 folder.
Note : PlugY directory and its contents can be put in a mpq.

------- D2File Patcher

If you have problem when you run PlugY.exe then use PatchD2File.exe. (It happend sometimes with Windows 2000)
- Do a backup of D2gfx.dll or game.exe.
- Run PatchD2File.exe which modify D2gfx.dll or Game.exe.
- Create a shortcut : Enter target mod directory in "start in" field of properties->shortcut. (unless you install PlugY in Diablo II directory)
- Launch with the shorcut !


******************** FAQ ******************

=> I can't find PlugY.ini file, where is it ?
In Windows Explorer, selecting Tools->Folder Options->View.
Mark "Show Hidden files and Folders".
Unmark "Hide extensions for know file types".
Then you will for sure see the ini file.


=> How do I Play sometimes on Battle.net when PlugY is installed ?
PlugY disable the connection to Battle.net.

=> What do I do if I have an error like "Bad Generic File" on loading a new Character ?
This can appear when you have bad item in the shared stash file.
A possible cause is to use same save folder for different mod.
In this case, just change the save folder in PlugY.ini.
You can also move the _LOD_SharedStashSave.sss and _LOD_HC_SharedStashSave.sss to another directory.

=> I get "sUnitItemInsertItemInvGridBase failed at 1046 in C:\projects\D2\head\Diablo2\Source\D2Client\UNIT\Item.cpp" in D2YYMMDD.txt, what I should do ?
It's just a warning, it causes no problem in game.


******** CONFIGURATION ********

Configuration of this kit for a specified mod :
- Copy PlugY.ini, PlugY.exe and PlugY folder in the target mod directory.

This file override parameters set by users in PlugY.ini.
Use it to enabled(disabled) wanted(unwanted) features.
Warning 1: ActivePlugin=0 doesn't work here (but ActivePlugin=1 works)
Warning 2: SavePath management is ignore in this file.
Warning 3: Don't abuse it, a lot of field should be set by users. (see note below)

- "PlugY/PlugYDefault.ini" in mpq or via the switch -direct
Use it to change default values of PlugY.
Works like PlugY.ini in an mpq in version 4.03 and before.
All fields should be here.
