- Copy PlugY.ini, PlugY.exe and PlugY folder (+its contents) in the targeted mod folder.
- Edit PlugY.ini to configure some features (see section below).
- Run PlugY.exe and enjoy :)

note : you can move the "PlugY" folder in "Diablo II" and it will be see by all PlugY installation.

Example :
You have installed Lord of Destruction here :  C:\Games\Diablo II\
And the mod to add this plug-in is here : D:\D2Mod\MyMod\
And the second mod to add this plug-in is here : D:\D2Mod\MyMod2\
So the new installation is :
   C:\Games\Diablo II\PlugY.dll
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\SharedGoldBtns.dc6
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\PlugYFixed.ini
   D:\D2Mod\MyMod\PlugY\PlugYDefault.ini

Uninstallation : Use the uninstaller or if you have check this option, simply remove all PlugY files !
Note : You can also move PlugY.dll in the mod folder but you must remove any on in D2 folder.
Note : PlugY directory and its contents can be put in a mpq. 

------- D2gfx Patcher :

If you have problem when you run PlugY.exe then use PatchD2gfxDll.exe. (It happend sometimes with Windows 2000)
- Go in Diablo II directory.
- Do a backup of D2gfx.dll (in the case, you remove PlugY before restore it)
- Run PatchD2gfxDll.exe (which patches D2gfx.dll for launch PlugY)
- Create a shortcut : Enter target mod directory in "start in" field of properties->shortcut. (unless you install PlugY in Diablo II directory)
- Launch with the shorcut !!

Before uninstall PlugY Restore your D2gfx.dll with your backup file or run RestoreD2gfxDll.exe.



******************** FAQ ******************

=> I can't find the PlugY.ini file, where is it ? 
>From kingpin :
Microsoft has in their OS hidden known extensions. This is to make sure newbie
users do not delete those files by accident. You can, of course, turn this off by
opening up your Windows Explorer, selecting Tools->Folder Options. Then choose View and
mark "Show Hidden files and Folders". Unmark "Hide extensions for know file types".
Then you will for sure see the ini file. 


=> How do I Play sometimes on Battle.net when PlugY is installed ?
PlugY automatically disables features on realm.
But it's always recommended to disable any third software when you go on realm.
Note : When bigStash is enabled, you must restart D2 for play in single/multi/open after playing in closed Bnet (and vice versa).
Tips : Make a shorcut and add -skiptobnet at the of the "target" field for directly go to Battle.net.


=> What do I do if I have an error like "Bad Generic File" on loading a new Character ? 
This can appear when you have bad item in the shared stash file. 
A possible cause is to use same save folder for different mod, in this case just change the save folder in PlugY.ini. 
You can also move the _LOD_SharedStashSave.sss and _LOD_HC_SharedStashSave.sss to another directory.


=> I get "sUnitItemInsertItemInvGridBase failed at 1046 in C:\projects\D2\head\Diablo2\Source\D2Client\UNIT\Item.cpp" in D2YYMMDD.txt, what I should do ? 
It's just a warning, don't worry about it, it causes no problem in game. 


=> I have another bug, what should I do ? 
1) Read my thread and post a question eventually in PhrozenKeep member annoucement forum.

2) Search on google, ask to your friend, etc but don't ask me, I have no more time to support PlugY.
If one day, I got enough time (like for the version 8.00) I will check forums to get the more commons problems.

Thx


******** CONFIGURATION ********

Configuration of this kit for a specified mod :
- Copy the PlugY.ini and PlugY.exe in the target mod directory (the directory where you start it, see it in the properties of the shortcut).
- In most cases, you will change the save directory in the ini file.
- Add all extra dll of the mod in PlugY.ini, if any.
- Finally, activate any specific features you want such as MultiPageStash, SharedStash, etc.
- Now, you can start the target mod using the classic method.

D2Mod configuration :
Just add the dll name in PlugY.ini, for example : "DllToLoad=D2Mod.dll"

Note:
- Items in the Cube are always saved on the player, if you want these items shared, you must remove them from the Cube.

Warning :
- Be careful if you want to edit the configurations files after having played with the mod.
- In multiplayer game, verify that the server has the same configuration.
- Remember : PlugY doesn't support realms.



*** Configuration for modders ***
There are 3 files with same structure to configure PlugY :
- "PlugY/PlugYFixed.ini" in mpq or via the switch -direct
All fields set parameters which can't be changed by users via PlugY.ini.
Use it for enabling(disabling) wanted(unwanted) features.
Only few thing should be found here.
Warning 1: ActivePlugin=0 doesn't work here (but ActivePlugin=1 works)
Warning 2: SavePath management doesn't work here too.
Warning 3: Don't abuse it, a lot of field should be set by users. (see note below)

- "PlugY/PlugYDefault.ini" in mpq or via the switch -direct
Use it for changing default values of PlugY.
Works like PlugY.ini in an mpq in version 4.03 and before.
All fields which aren't in PlugYFixed.ini (and are always readed) should be here.
Most fields should be put here.

- "PlugY.ini" in current directory only.
For users' configuration (like previous version).
Fields which are in PlugYFixed.ini shouldn't be found here.
In most cases, this file is the same as PlugYDefault.ini but it can be edited by user.

Notes:
Think about each features if you really must disable it.
- The savepath management doesn't work in Fixed.ini (it's users' choice where they want to put their save files)
- The unassignment of skills can really be useful way to learn all your custom skills. I have stopped playing some mods just because I don't know what skill will be useful at very high level. It's more fun to try all skills and do the choosing after that. So don't put it in Fixed.ini
- The World Event should be configured or disabled in Fixed.ini in each mod.
- The extra pages in stats interfaces shouldn't be put in Fixed.ini

Modders can contact me, if they want help or more details about this system.

WARNING : Don't forget, if it's misused, players will use old version of PlugY, and I will have no other choice than to disable it.
